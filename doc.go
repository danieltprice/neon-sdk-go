/* The package to communicate to the Neon Postgres SaaS Platform.

The Neon API allows you to access and manage Neon programmatically. You can use the Neon API to manage API keys, projects, branches, endpoints, databases, roles, and operations. For information about these features, refer to the [Neon documentation](https://neon.tech/docs/cloud/about/).

If you are logged in to Neon, you can run Neon API requests from this page using the **Try it out** feature. Your requests are authenticated automatically. Otherwise, you must authenticate by specifying an API key. You can view and manage API keys in the Neon Console. See [Using API Keys](https://neon.tech/docs/get-started-with-neon/using-api-keys/) for information about generating and using Neon API keys.
